# learning-solidity

these solidity files cover most of the functionality needed to write a basic smart contract, including: 
1) Iheritance (e.g. contract myToken is ERC20Token...)
2) public / private / internal / external functions
3) fallback() functions
4) importing a library
5) creating and emitting events
6) creating and applying modifiers
7) payable addressess and functions
8) enum, struct, uint / uint256, int, string, address types
9) defining and appending to arrays
10) mapping (e.g. mapping (uint => User) public users;)
11) correct usage of override and virtual functions
12) correct usage of msg and tx to get addresses
13) use of super to retain base functionality of an inherited method
